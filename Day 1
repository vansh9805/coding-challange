# Day 1 â€“ Continuing the Grind

## Learning Track  
Today, I selected the **Love Babbar DSA Playlist** to follow on YouTube:  
ðŸ”— [Love Babbar DSA Sheet + Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA)  
Iâ€™ll begin watching it tomorrow as I start revising core DSA topics step-by-step.

Note: I haven't studied Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) yet, so for now, Iâ€™m only solving **math-based problems** on LeetCode that rely on logic and basic programming.
Once I gain confidence and understanding in DSA topics, Iâ€™ll shift to solving array, string, and recursion problems.


##  Solved LeetCode Problems

###  Problem 1: [231. Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

###  My Approach
- First, I checked for edge cases:
  - If `n == 1`, return true.
  - If `n <= 0`, return false.
- Then I used a loop to repeatedly divide `n` by 2.
- If at any point `n` is not divisible by 2, itâ€™s not a power of two.
- If the loop ends cleanly, `n` is a power of two.

###  Time Complexity:- O(log n) â€“ because the number is divided by 2 in each step.

###  Space Complexity:- O(1) â€“ no extra space is used.

###  Notes: Iâ€™m not familiar with DSA optimizations yet, but Iâ€™ll revisit this problem later after learning bit manipulation and other techniques.


###  Problem 2: [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

###  My Approach
- I handled base cases for 0 and 1.
- Then, I used a brute-force method to check numbers from 1 to x/2.
- For each number, I checked whether it had crossed the square root condition.
- Returned the integer part of the square root.

### Time Complexity:- O(n) â€“ linear loop up to `x/2`.

###  Space Complexity:- O(1) â€“ no additional space required.

###  Learning Experience:
Initially, I tried a more mathematical method using logarithms and exponentiation with Taylor series to get an accurate answer, but it became too complicated.  
I switched to this simple approach for now and will revisit it later using binary search once I learn it.


##  Plan for Tomorrow
- Start Love Babbar DSA Playlist.
- Solve 1â€“2 more LeetCode problems.
- Try to improve today's solutions using more optimized techniques.
- Keep updating this log daily!
