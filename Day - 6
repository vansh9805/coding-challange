Day 6 â€“ Continued STL Learning and Debugging Practice
Today, I continued learning STL in C++ using Love Babbar's tutorial. 
Focused on understanding the core STL containers like vectors, sets, and maps, and practiced basic operations on them.

LeetCode Problem Attempted:
 238. Product of Array Except Self
ðŸ”— Problem Link â€“ https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Reflection:
I implemented a brute-force approach that calculates the product for each index by skipping the current one.
Although the logic was correct, it caused a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) due to its O(nÂ²) time complexity.
I learned that such nested loops are inefficient for large arrays and realized I need to explore a better approach using prefix and suffix products.

Tomorrowâ€™s Plan:
Reattempt this problem using an optimized O(n) solution with prefix/suffix arrays or constant space.
Practice STL vector and map-based problems.
Continue 1 GFG + 1â€“2 LeetCode problems daily.
