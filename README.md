#Coding Challenge 
Welcome to my daily coding challenge repository! This is where I document my journey of solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and coding challenges as part of my preparation for college placements.

# Daily Goals
1. Solve LeetCode questions
2.Practice core DSA topics
3. Improve coding speed and problem-solving skills
4. Track progress consistently

# Why This Repo?
I'm using this as a personal log of consistent coding practice to:
1. Stay disciplined in prep for placements
2. Identify patterns and improve weak areas
3. Share my learning path with others
