Day 10 – Almost Cracked Majority Element II (LC 229)
Today, I tried solving LeetCode 229 – Majority Element II.
While the problem wasn’t too difficult, I couldn’t complete it fully due to time constraints.

Problem Attempted:
LeetCode 229 – Majority Element II
I understood the core idea — finding elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.
I nearly got the solution working but didn’t have enough time to debug and finalize it.

Reflection:
It’s okay to not complete a problem every day — what matters is that I showed up and gave it a try.
I could recognize patterns from previous majority-element problems, which means my intuition is improving.
Will revisit this problem tomorrow with a fresh mind.

Tomorrow’s Plan:
Finish solving LeetCode 229 completely.
