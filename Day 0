# Day 0 - Kickstarting the Journey
  
# My Coding Background
Iâ€™m a C developer familiar with the basics of programming, including variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
Iâ€™ve already built small projects in C like:
Tic-Tac-Toe game,
Menu-driven programs.
Simple file handling projects

Now Iâ€™m starting my journey into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and competitive coding to gear up for college placements.
This repository will serve as a daily log of my learning, growth, and problem-solving progress.

# Todayâ€™s Milestone: LeetCode Problem #9 - Palindrome Number
ðŸ”— Problem Link
https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/

# Thought Process
First, I checked if the number is negative â€” if yes, itâ€™s not a palindrome.
Then, I stored the original number to compare later.
I reversed the number using mathematical operations:
Get the last digit using n % 10
Build the reverse number by shifting the current digits using multiplication
Finally, I compared the reversed number with the original number.


# What I Learned
How to reverse a number using math.
How to handle edge cases like negative numbers.
How simple problems still need a good grip on logic.

# Plan for Tomorrow
Research and pick a DSA playlist/channel on YouTube to follow regularly.
Start revising core DSA topics (arrays, strings, etc.).
Solve at least 1 more problem and document it here.
